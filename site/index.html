    Ten Principles for Good Design
  </h1>
        <section class="flex-1">
          <div>
           <h4>1</h4>
           <h2>innovative</h2>

           <h3>The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for original designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.</h3>
        </section>

        <section class="flex-2">
          <div>
           <h4>2</h4>

         </div>
         <h3>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic criteria. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could detract from it.</h3>

  <h3> The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products are used every day and have an effect on people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be beautiful.
  </h3>

  <h3>It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user’s intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.
</h3>

    <div>
     <h4>5</h4>
     <h2>unobtrusive</h2>
    </div>

   </div>
   <h3> Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.
   </h3>
